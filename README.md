# A Simple Barcode Reader App built in Swift

Apple has made the barcode scanning process a breeze to implement. We will be diving into the world of AV Foundation Framework to build a neat little iPhone app that reads barcodes on CDs, gets some important information about the Album, and prints it to the app’s view. Reading the barcodes is cool and important, but we’ll take it a step further and do something neat with the barcode number that we receive.

It should probably go without saying, but a barcode scanning app will only work on a device equipped with a camera. With that in mind, let’s grab our camera-equipped iOS devices and get started!
